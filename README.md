# Conway's Game of Obligatory

Everybody's gotta do this at least once, right?

### Controls
- `R`: randomizes the screen
- `P`: pauses the screen
- `N`: when paused, goes through one single turn of the game.

Later on I might add some additional features like mouse support, but I don't see myself doing that unless I get very bored. This project was mainly to learn `ggez`, after all.
